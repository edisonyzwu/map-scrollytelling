# Migration Journey Scrollytelling
This project is an interactive scrollytelling experience that visualizes the migration journey of individuals traveling across regions toward a new beginning. As the user scrolls, the map dynamically updates to show key locations, paths, and milestones along the way.

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to combine narrative storytelling with geographic visualization. It highlights the challenges, decisions, and landscapes encountered during the migration process, offering a more immersive understanding of the journey.

The scrollytelling experience is built using:

- Mapbox GL JS for interactive mapping

- Scrollama.js for scroll-driven events

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout and styling
